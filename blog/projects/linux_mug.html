<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
As a software developer I love working with different tools and programming languages. Often
you can end up switching between these day-to-day depending on the
project and priorities. Programming languages can be different in a lot of ways, including
syntax, how they are compiled and how certain technical details like memory management work.
Tools such as integrated development environments or text editors can have different
keyboard shortcuts and commands.
</p>
<p>
When switching between projects it is easy to get caught out by these subtle
differences and so you might end up Googling simple things, for example, how to iterate
over a dict/hashmap in Javascript after having worked on a Golang project for a month.
What you're often looking for in these situations is a few pointers or
examples of how to do certain things.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I enjoy a cup of tea or coffee.</strong>
Whenever I'm working there is a mug
on my desk. Either awaiting or containing a hot beverage. It is probably fair to say this is
common in most office based professions.
</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>
<strong>
In order to solve this problem I have
designed a mug crammed with as much quick reference information
as possible.
</strong>
It sits on my desk where generally a hot drink is on-hand before 3pm and if
I need to look up something it might save me a Google search!
It's not an original idea, there were a few around back-in-the-day. However, some searching failed to find one that
really crams as much useful information as physically possible and looks good.
</p>
<p>
For the first mug the subject is
<strong>the Linux command line</strong>. Why? Well...
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It is a subject I am presently familiar with but still have to occasionally Google
something - so now is probably the best time to jot down some good
commands.
</li>
<li>
For a first attempt I wanted to allow myself time to work on the design of the mugs and
not strive to learn a whole new subject.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Technical Design Considerations</h3>
<p>
If you are looking to create merchandise like this there are increasingly more companies
able to create products with your designs. For this my initial choice was
<a href="https://www.redbubble.com/">Red Bubble</a>
. I had purchased a gift from them before and the recipient was happy with it.
They have good guidelines on what dimensions work best for
different products, so all I had to do was create an image of that exact size, upload it to
their website and order it.
</p>
<p>
So that it is possible to make more of these designs with minimal effort I wanted styling to be
decoupled from the content. HTML and stylesheets (CSS) is what we typically use for
websites. CSS to provides styling, AKA how things look,
and HTML contains details about the content. When it comes to making a change to one
of the quick reference snippets it is just a matter of changing the HTML.
On the other hand, if the background colour was to be changed only
the stylesheets would need a small update.
</p>

<img alt='The HAML for the linux mug' src='images/linux_mug_code.png'>
<div class='caption'>
<p>
The mug content as HAML, when compiled using nanoc generates a formatted
image as shown in the photos.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class='col-md-6'>
<p>
To generate the individual mugs' designs what I actually created was a static "website"
that could be rendered into an image as part of a pipeline process.
</p>
<p>
Although the web-page for each mug would be static there is a need to introduce some
dynamic elements. This is to limit repetition in the code and allow templates to define
the layout. For this I have used
<a href="https://nanoc.ws/">Nanoc</a>
a static site generator in Ruby. Nanoc allows for the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>HAML</strong>
- A templating language for generating HTML which removes the rather annoying need to
remember to close every HTML element, but does require you to indent everything...
</li>
<li>
<strong>SASS support</strong>
- Allows variables and other cool things that CSS lacks. Using this a single variable
can specify the primary colour for the theme and generate a palette of other colours
based off it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Custom filters</strong>
- For this I added a filter which actually calls Google Chrome to render the image of
the mug content as part of the static generated files.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Other cool stuff</strong>
- You can use it to detect broken links, validate HTML and CSS, verify accessibility
and more.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So whenever I make a change to the design or content of the mugs I run
<code>nanoc compile</code>
and the static content for the site is generated. This is a simpler and cheaper to host than
server-side dynamic websites using, for example, PHP, Ruby on Rails or Java. You can still
create a great website, host it cheaply but with some limitations on interactive elements.
In fact this website is generated using Nanoc and uploaded to an S3 bucket. As a result it's
super cheap to host.
</p>
<p>
The mug's static content is defined as snippets using specific CSS classes and code examples
using
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
elements in HTML. Optionally,
<code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
tags are thrown in to apply semantics, such as emphasis on the
command the snippet is for and values that should be substituted. There are some layout
specific elements to arrange the mug into four columns and to fit two snippets next to one
another. Essentially all the hard work on
the design for this mug can be reused for the next.

<h4>Prototyping</h4>
</div>
</div>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-md-9'>
<p>
In order to get the content right and typo free I printed the design onto
paper, cropped and cello-taped it to an old coffee mug. This allowed me to try the snippets
as intended as well as write notes and corrections directly on it. What became clear
from doing this was that light text on
a dark background, standard with old-style terminals, does not work well when printed.
I used this prototype for a couple of weeks. Once happy with the design it was
uploaded and an order was placed.

<h3>The Finished Product</h3>
<p>
After placing the order my new mug arrived a few
days later. It has been in regular use ever since and overall I am very happy with it.
The intention was to have a link to buy these with this update,
<em>however the mug that Red Bubble sent me had some pretty bad smudges at the edges...</em>
So before that happens I need to try some other websites.

Please follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/aggronerd">@aggronerd on Twitter</a>
for updates on when the Linux Quick Reference Mug will be available to buy.
</strong>
I will post updates EVERYWHERE as soon as they are available.

<p>
Towards the other side the snippets become more elaborate and require a bit of
reverse-engineering if you're new to this stuff but the idea is that it can help you
revise. Sometimes the best way to learn something is to try it. If a snippet is
potentially destructive they have a skull symbol to indicate that.

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
Even if you know most of it there might be something on there
you look at which is new or you might need a refresher on. If you return to the Linux
terminal after a long hiatus you can just whip out this mug, fill it with your favourite
beverage, and have a quick refresher on how to redirect stderr to stdout.
</p>
<p>
I hope to find out if it can be used as a learning aid to someone relatively new to
the field. It would have helped me when I was 22 straight out of uni get to grasp with some
practical examples.
</p>
<p>
A possible concern is that the sheer amount of snippets and their shorthand nature may
overwhelm or be useless. I personally prefer to learn from doing and first-principles. It
would be good to get feedback on this aspect.
</p>
<p>
I plan open some channels for feedback and perhaps do polls
on what future mugs should cover as subjects and possibly setup a Pateron page... Buying
these mugs would be a fantastic way to support this ongoing work.
</p>
<h3>
Possible Issues
</h3>
<p>
There were a few things that crossed my mind whilst doing this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Everyone's usage of the linux command-line is different. They're not hyper personalised
but could be to use someone's preferred editor, for example, or include Red Hat flavour
of commands instead.
</li>
<li>
The snippets/commands are going to get out-of-date due to changes in the technology.
</li>
<li>
There are not much protections for the designs, does that matter?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With that last point in mind the tools for generating the mug designs could be open-source,
ideally with a license that wouldn't prohibit them from being sold in order to support the
designers/developers working on it. They would be much better with the
combined wisdom of a community of developers. Other people working on these designs would
open them to corrections including when they become out of date.
</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>
Once the initial mug is available to buy I would like to make another one. Here are some
ideas for which subjects to do next, but I'm open to suggestions so please get in contact
if you have some ideas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Golang</strong>
(covering syntax, commands and common libraries) - For this it will be interesting to
style larger snippets, rather than the single line examples on the Linux mug.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Manderin Chinese</strong>
- get some basic phrases in romanised form (Pinyin) to help someone practise and
memorise them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Typescript with React</strong>
- Every blue moon I come back to working with Typescript so would really benefit
from the main method names used and examples of things like hooks.
</li>
</ul>
