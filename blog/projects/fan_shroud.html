<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
A recent upgrade to my PC prompted me with a problem. My computer case is a
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/node/node-202/black/">Fractal Design Node 202</a>
, which is small form factor but can pack a decent Mini ITX
motherboard, SFX power supply unit and a full sized graphics card. It powers VR gaming and
takes up far less desk space than a lot of other cases.
</p>
<p>
My recent upgrade included a beefier processor and I already had a
<a href="https://www.quietpc.com/gel-slim-hero">Gelid Solutions SlimHero</a>
which could be adapted to fit the AM4 CPU, however the height was somehow a few millimeters
higher than my existing one. As a result it was making contact with the case's 120mm fan
shroud. The SlimHero a is fantastically quiet and efficient cooler so rather
than replacing it I printed a thinner shroud with dust protective mesh.

<p>
There was
<strong>
just
</strong>
enough space to close the lid on the case without the factory shroud but
without it there is a risk of dust degrading the performance of the cooler.

The original also has two clips which needed to be removed and the new shroud would
need to fit a different way.

<h3>
Solution
</h3>
<p>
The original design was 5mm thick so I attempted to copy the design fairly closely and,
instead of having clips to attach it to the case, added space for 2 small Neodymium magnets
that would lock it to the steel of the case.
</p>
<p>
It was easy to create in Autodesk Fusion 360 and in under an hour it was printing on my
Prusa i3 Mk3.

<p>
Epoxy was used to fix the mesh material to the printed frame. This shows a material I
used on a newer version of this which is a nicer black. Presure must be applied while
the epoxy is setting.

<h3>
Conclusions
</h3>
<p>
The new shroud fits well and the magnets seem to hold really well. I was a little concerned
about the magnets fixing to the wrong thing or giving some interference but so far so good.
Biggest issue was that there was no nice way to push the mesh onto the printed frame and
apply the epoxy without the epoxy sticking to whatever applies the pressure on it. I tried
icing sugar thinking that it would dissolve but it just made the epoxy white!
